                <h3>I am a coffee professional based in Brooklyn, New York.</h3>

                <p>
                    If there's one thing in life that's always made me happy, it's been coffee. When I was 16-years-old, my parents made me get a part time job as a hostess at a restaurant in my hometown. After getting promoted to their coffee bar in 2010, the rest is history. Since then, this happiness has extended well past serving coffee to teaching, writing, and simply geeking out about it with others. I've made countless friends and connections in coffee over the years, and it's hard to picture myself ever doing anything else.
